Velocitek makes nice GPS designed for sailors. Those devices have functionality that is only available once the device is connected to a computer. Unfortunately Velocitek only provide proprietary software on Windows.

This project is aimed at providing an application on the Mac that can access and modify the settings, download the GPS tracks and upgrade the firmware.
